proof of concept hypermedia generator

## notes

- we want to stay as close to the wire as we can
- modeling begins with a mockup of an example client
- then input/outputs to support the mockup are capture into json _with values_
- a graph can now be generated from this json
- a hypermedia api can now be generated from this json
- let's generate a super basic one that can be regenerated without overwriting customization
